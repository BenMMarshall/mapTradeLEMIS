# mapTradeLEMIS

A repository of code used to summarise and explore the origins and sources of wildlife trade based on previous releases of LEMIS trade data. The original dataset is available as part of Marshall et al., (2025), which expanded upon data curated by Eskew et al., (2019a; 2020). We have made the data, with additional distribution fields, created through the use of the code desrcibed here available at <DATA REPOSITORY DOI HERE>, alongside the GBIFIDs of all used occurrence data points.
